NOTE
====

This variant (it's not exactly a fork...) of wifi-tether is a modification to work on RCMod ROMs for ADQ devices (which use rfkill instead of a wifi module to control state), and it's not meant to work on other devices or ROMs.

Although the changes in this version are fairly simple, they do exist.

* Build changes to compile as part of a ROM
* Script and code changes to use rfkill

If anything goes wrong, blame me, not the original author :)
